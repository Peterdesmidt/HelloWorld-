</p> My name is Peter DeSmidt I go to St.John's in Burlington where I am in Eighth grade.I choose this class for a few reasons. One of
  the reasons I choose this class is because I have done some programming before.(C++) Another reason why I chose this class is because
I was really interested in web page design and I wanted to know how to create websites.</p>
